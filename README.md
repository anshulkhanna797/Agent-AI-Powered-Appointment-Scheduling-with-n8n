# Agent-AI-Powered-Appointment-Scheduling-with-n8n
This project is an AI-powered appointment scheduling system built using n8n. The system allows users to submit their preferred appointment dates, and based on these dates, it automatically triggers an email notification to a designated person who can handle the appointment.

It incorporates conditional logic (if-else statements) to check the dates and ensure proper handling of each request. The AI agent can also manage and resolve user queries related to the appointments.

Key Features:

AI-driven appointment management using n8n workflows

Automated email notifications based on user input

Conditional logic to validate and process appointments

Handles and resolves user queries efficiently

Technologies Used:

n8n (for workflow automation)

Email integration (SMTP or other service)

Conditional logic (if-else statements)
